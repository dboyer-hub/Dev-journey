# Day 3 – Developer Journey

## What I worked on
- Studied `div` and `class` concepts
- Completed the Bookstore project from freeCodeCamp
- Practiced structuring sections and reusable classes

## What I learned
- How `div` elements group content
- How `class` attributes are used for styling and structure
- Why classes are reusable and important for layout
- How buttons fit into page structure (e.g. checkout actions)

## Challenges / Bugs
- Understanding when to use multiple divs vs fewer containers
- Visualizing how layout sections relate to each other

## Code / Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS (basic)
- freeCodeCamp editor

## Progress Made
- Built a multi-section Bookstore layout
- Created a structured page with buttons and grouped content

## Next Action (Tomorrow)
- Continue HTML Foundational learning
