# Day 4 – Developer Journey

## What I worked on

- Practiced embedding media using native HTML elements

## What I learned
- How the `<video>` element works with controls and source files
- How to embed audio using the `<audio>` element
- The importance of fallback text for unsupported browsers
- How media elements fit into semantic page structure

## Challenges / Bugs

- Ensuring the video and audio load correctly from external sources

## Code / Tools Used

- `<video>` and `<audio>` elements
- External media sources (freeCodeCamp CDN)

## Progress Made
