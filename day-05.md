# Day 5 – Developer Journey

## What I worked on
- Studied HTML images and media formats
- Learned the differences between raster images and SVG graphics
- Reviewed when to use JPG, PNG, and SVG formats

## What I learned
- Raster images (JPG, PNG) are resolution-dependent and can lose quality when scaled
- SVG images are vector-based and scale without losing quality
- JPG is best for photographs and images with many colors
- PNG supports transparency and is better for graphics and icons
- SVG is ideal for logos, icons, and responsive designs due to infinite scalability
- Image format choice impacts performance, quality, and responsiveness

## Challenges / Considerations
- Deciding the best image format based on use case
- Balancing image quality with file size for performance

## Code / Tools Used
- HTML `<img>` element
- Raster image formats (JPG, PNG)
- Vector graphics (SVG)

## Progress Made
- Improved understanding of image optimization and scalability
- Gained awareness of performance considerations in web design

## Next Action (Tomorrow)
- Apply image formats in a project
- Continue advancing HTML/CSS concepts and layout practices
